### The Honest Maker

<b>Who is "The Honest Maker"?</b><br>
My name is Larry Bank and I have a mission to create projects and products that adhere to four main values:<br>
<br>
- Honesty: No exaggerated claims or unrealistic expectations. Project examples will include info about the true difficulty level.<br>
- Utility: Clear benefit/utility in every project/product.<br>
- Simplicity: All products are fully open source with detailed documentation, plenty of examples and easy to understand use cases.<br>
- Affordability: All products priced fairly and accessible to as wide an audience as possible<br>
<br>
<b>Why are you creating these products?</b><br>
I started creating open source software (and more recently hardware) for my own uses and thought that others could benefit from them as well. When it comes to open source hardware, most people can't really make use of it. My aim is to create unique products and sell them at fair prices. If instead, you would like to make them yourself, all of the necessary files are available.
