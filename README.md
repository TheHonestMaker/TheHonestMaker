### The Honest Maker

<b>Who is "The Honest Maker"?</b><br>
My name is Larry Bank and I have a mission to create projects and products that adhere to four main values:<br>
<br>
- Honesty: No exaggerated claims or unrealistic expectations; project examples include info about the true difficulty level.<br>
- Utility: Each product solves a specific problem or provides a delightful feature.<br>
- Open Source: All products are fully open source (both hardware and software) with detailed documentation, and plenty of examples.<br>
- Affordability: All products are priced fairly and accessible to a wide audience<br>
<br>
<b>Why are you creating these products?</b><br>
I started creating open source software (and more recently hardware) for my own use and thought that others could benefit from them as well. When it comes to open source hardware, most people can't really make use of it. My aim is to create unique products and sell them at fair prices. If instead of buying pre-built hardware, you would like to make them yourself, all of the necessary files are available.
